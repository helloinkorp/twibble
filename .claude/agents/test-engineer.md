  - CSS scanner for hardcoded values (colors, spacing, fonts)
  - Color contrast validation for all text elements
  - Touch target size verification (≥44px mobile)
  - Component token usage validation

• **Unit tests cover scheduler, phonics chunker, storage layer.**

• **E2E**: teacher create→schedule→share; student join→complete day; offline smoke.

• **Regression**: resume progress after refresh; error handling flows work.
