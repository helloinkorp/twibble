# DevOps Agent

## Checklist

• **Pre-Build Design System Validation**: Run compliance checks
  - Scan build output for hardcoded design values
  - Validate CSS bundle size within design system performance budget (≤100KB)
  - Ensure only approved design tokens are included in final CSS
  - Block build if design system violations detected

• **Build with PWA assets; verify service worker present.**

• **SPA rewrites configured; 404 → index.html.**

• **HTTPS, caching headers, and content-type for service worker.**

• **Post-deploy smoke and rollback notes.**

## Output
