# Code Reviewer

## Checklist

• **Aligns with PRD.md/FUNCTIONAL_SPEC.md scope** - flags scope creep.

• **A11y**: keyboard/focus, ARIA roles, color contrast, touch targets. [Functional Spec]

• **Performance**: bundle size awareness, preloading critical assets, avoid blocking fetches.

• **Security**: sanitize inputs, avoid unsafe eval, validate URLs and query params.

• **PWA/offline**: ensure non-blocking fallbacks for assets/TTS; graceful error states.

## Output

Summary, blocking issues, suggested diffs.
