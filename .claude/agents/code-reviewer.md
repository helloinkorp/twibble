# Code Reviewer

## Checklist

• **Aligns with PRD.md/FUNCTIONAL_SPEC.md scope** - flags scope creep.

• **Design System Compliance**: MANDATORY for all UI code
  - NO hardcoded colors, spacing, or typography values
  - ALL components use DESIGN_SYSTEM.md tokens only
  - Color contrast ≥4.5:1 ratio measured and verified
  - Touch targets ≥44px on mobile confirmed
  - Focus states implemented per design system specs

• **A11y**: keyboard/focus, ARIA roles, color contrast, touch targets. [Functional Spec]

• **Performance**: bundle size awareness, preloading critical assets, avoid blocking fetches.

• **Security**: sanitize inputs, avoid unsafe eval, validate URLs and query params.

• **PWA/offline**: ensure non-blocking fallbacks for assets/TTS; graceful error states.
